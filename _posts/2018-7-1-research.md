Being in the final year can be stressful. You have to look for a job (work on the thesis). Eventually, that's what most people settle for. I'm too in my final year, and unlike everyone else in my situation, I'm not thinking about getting a job. Even if I would, I'm sure it'll be related to research. And I usually get asked a lot about why I want to pursue research and why not go for a job. And in my mind, I'm like **why not**, but I don't think it is that simple. So let me explain.

To begin with, I love my research more than I thought I would in my first year at college. Because like everyone else, I thought it to be boring and without having any practical use case.
'''
I remember telling one of my friends working on her thesis, "how boring it would be to work on a thesis."
'''

But that is not the case. After being in my friend's situation, I don't think it is as dull as it sounds. Also, I get to work on fascinating problems that have not been solved before, and there is no way that can be boring. And usually, they have high impact value too, plus, I get to choose the kind of problems that I want to work on. Doesn't it sound like a perfect thing? 
Don't get me wrong, I know nothing is perfect, and **YES** finances are an essential part of life too, and I get it. And that is one of the reasons why I can afford to do it now. I can live with bare minimum expenses right now and still function on 5-hour sleep. I know in the end I have to get a job. But I don't think it's the right time.

Another question that comes to mind is that:

### Why not have job experience before it?

It might seem a tempting option and a more practical one too. But for anyone familiar with computation linguistics knows that NLP is finally having its moment. People are finally starting to understand how it works, and because of that, several unsolved problems are coming up. And for someone who has been working on them, it is too big of an opportunity to miss. 
Anyone not familiar with NLP is similar to the famous, **Diffusion of innovations theory**. Currently, we are close to the innovators and the early adopters, which is an excellent time situation to be in.

I admit that there is a risk, too, and it's a typical choice anyone would take. But If I have to take the risk. It has to be now; there is too little to lose and much to gain.
