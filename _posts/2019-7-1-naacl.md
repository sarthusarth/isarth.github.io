There are very few people who are lucky enough to attend an ACL conference as undergraduate students. In fact, at the conference too, I met very few of them. That's why I wanted to write this blog about **"what is it like to an ACL conference"**, NAACL'19 in my case. This blog is only about my experience and not about what I learned at NAACL (maybe I will write about it in the other post).


A few weeks back, I had an opportunity of my life (at least what I would like to call it ) to attend NAACL and present two posters in the SemEval workshop. For some unfamiliar with ACL conferences, there are three big NLP conferences: ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL (a few more, but these are the top ones).

And not surprisingly, attending one for the first time is an OVERWHELMING experience. You go there on the first day, and you walk past Dr. Chis Manning, Sebastian Rudder, Rada Mihalcea, Abigail See, Emily Bender, and you name any top people working in the NLP community is there somewhere. But what is surprising is that all are openly available for a chat, which made my experience invaluable.

I had an opportunity to talk to a few of them and ask them about their work and take advice from them. On the first day itself, I was lucky enough to get the chance to meet Sebastian Rudder and ask him about how the master's and the Ph.D. program works in Europe compared to the US. The next day was even better. I got the chance to speak to Dr. Rada Mihalcea ( I was so hesitant about talking to her but glad I had enough courage ) just for anyone unfamiliar; she is the Director of Michigan AI Lab and was one of the Keynote speakers in the NAACL'19 as well. Talking to her made me think more about my motivation to do research or master's or even Ph.D. somewhere down the line, which was worth traveling this far from India. And I got to meet and thank Abigail See for her excellent NLP lectures for CS224n.


You get to meet the top researchers and other masters or Ph.D. students from leading universities. The best advice that I got was "To find time for a hobby apart from work. It will keep you humble and help you in life" from a fantastic Ph.D. student.

And that’s not all; you get to hang out with some incredible people, explore the city (Minneapolis) and have dinner. Be friends with them, hoping that you’ll meet again at some NLP conference. I wish I had pictures to share how awesome it was. But here is the view of the bridge we went to.

What it does to you is that after the end of the conference, you are motivated to work on something worthwhile, come back again next year, and relive the experience. I hope to be back at ACL 2020 :)
